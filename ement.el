;;; Commentary:

;; Another Matrix client!  This one is written from scratch and is
;; intended to be more "Emacsy," more suitable for MELPA, etc.  Also
;; it has a shorter, perhaps catchier name, that is a mildly clever
;; play on the name of the official Matrix client and the Emacs Lisp
;; filename extension (oops, I explained the joke), which makes for
;; much shorter symbol names.
